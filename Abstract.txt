The title of the project is Automated CCTV using Object Detection System. We know that surveillance security is a very tedious 
and time-consuming job. Automating the task of analyzing video surveillance will be very helpful in this regard.
By using automated CCTVs less manpower will be required and it will also provide effective monitoring. 
There are many ways of automating a CCTV. Here we will be using YOLO Object Detection with OpenCV and Python. 
YOLO is the algorithm behind how the code will detect objects in an image or video. This will result in bounding boxes around objects. 
We can also send mail alert for each object detected by using Pythonâ€™s built-in smtplib module. It will help in adopting new security trends. 
Also the model can be trained in a way to detect various actions of humans and tell if they are threatening.
